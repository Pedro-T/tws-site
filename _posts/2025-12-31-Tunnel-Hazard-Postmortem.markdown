#### Inspiration

Game & Watch was a series of handheld single-title game units released in 1980 by Nintendo and produced for about a decade. These were basic early handhelds which each had a single game. I never had an actual Game & Watch (this was before my time, I started with a Game Boy Color), but I did have Game & Watch Gallery 2 for the aforementioned Game Body Color. This was a game cartridge released in 1998 which contained both updated and true-to-original versions of six of the classic Game & Watch games from the handhelds:
- Ball
- Chef
- Donkey Kong
- Parachute
- Vermin

and of course, <strong>Helmet</strong>.

Helmet is a game where the player avoids tools falling from the sky while collecting a point for each door reached. In the updated version, Mario (or Wario) also collects coins.

I played a LOT of this game in 1999-2000 and when thinking of an interesting small project to learn with, it popped back into my head over two decades later.
