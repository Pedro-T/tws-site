### Description
Deer in the Headlights is a very short game created for the 20 Second Game Jam, 2025 edition. Play as a deer who has accidentally run onto a freeway while trying to escape the hunter. Escape within twenty seconds by dodging the vehicles and reaching the exit. If you're interested in a short post-mortem about its development, check <a href="/posts/dith-postmortem">here</a>.

### Technology / Tools
- Godot 4.5 & GDScript
- 2d pixel art (Aseprite)
- Audacity for some audio edits

### How to Play
- Move the deer using WASD or the arrow keys
- Your goal is to reach the exit point at the top of the play area
- You lose if the deer is hit by any vehicle.
- There is a twenty second timer before the hunter, who is a terrible shot, finally will hit you. If it expires before you reach the exit, you lose!
- The exit is not available from the start! Wait for the van to move.
