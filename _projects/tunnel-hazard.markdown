## Tech / Tools
<ul>
<li>Godot 4.5 & GDScript</li>
<li>2D Pixel Art (Aseprite)</li>
<li>Audacity</li>
</ul>

## Instructions & Gameplay
<ul>
<li>Move left and right using A and D keys, or arrow keys. <i>Mobile controls are also available - use the onscreen arrows</i></li>
<li>Hold space (or tap the center button) to enter catching mode</li>
<li>The goal is to move to the right side of the screen and enter the open door in order to move to the next stage / room</li>
<li>The exit door opens after an increasing delay</li>
<li>Avoid the falling items - getting hit means losing!</li>
<li>Pick up the random lost items on the ground for extra points</li>
</ul>

## Upgrades & Events

<p><strong>A Hard Hat</strong> may spawn randomly on the ground in place of a loot item. Pick up a hard hat to put it on which allows the player to be hit once without losing, after which the hat is knocked off.</p>

<p><strong>Cats</strong> may fall from above. Cats can be caught by entering and remaining in the catch stance (space bar or center touch button). A caught cat will hop into the player's backpack and provide a score bonus on exiting the stage. Cats which are not caught will run away. Cats can only spawn once the door opens.</p>
