### Description
Tunnel Hazard is a small game inspired by the classic Game and Watch game Helmet from the 1980s as well as its slightly more modern equivalent from the Game & Watch Gallery 2 cartridge on the Game Boy Color.

<p class="notice">This game is <i>in development</i> and undergoing continuous changes. A playable development build is available on Itch and is updated at the conclusion of each iteration cycle, provided the current state is stable.<br /><a href="#roadmap">Jump to Roadmap</a></p>

### Tech / Tools

- Godot 4.5 & GDScript
- 2D Pixel Art (Aseprite)
- Audacity

### Instructions & Gameplay
- Move left and right using A and D keys, or arrow keys. Mobile controls are also available - use the onscreen arrows
- Hold space (or tap the center button) to enter catching mode
- The goal is to move to the right side of the screen and enter the open door in order to move to the next stage / room
- The exit door opens after an increasing delay
- Avoid the falling items - getting hit means losing!
- Pick up the random lost items on the ground for extra points

#### Upgrades & Events

**A Hard Hat** may spawn randomly on the ground in place of a loot item. Pick up a hard hat to put it on which allows the player to be hit once without losing, after which the hat is knocked off.

**Cats** may fall from above. Cats can be caught by entering and remaining in the catch stance (space bar or center touch button). A caught cat will hop into the player's backpack and provide a score bonus on exiting the stage. Cats which are not caught will run away. Cats can only spawn once the door opens.
